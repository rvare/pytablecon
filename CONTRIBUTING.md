# Preamble

This contributing guide goes over how the code should be written, how to test, how to report bugs, and pull requests.

# Style Guide

This project will try to follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for the actual code and [PEP 257](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) for the docstrings as closely as possible. Be sure to be familiar with them before working.

We will also utilize [PEP 3107](https://peps.python.org/pep-3107/) for functons and [PEP 526](https://peps.python.org/pep-0526/) for variables when possible.

Even though we will follow the PEPs as closely as possible, there are some things that are specific to the project:

- Keep variable names to nouns.
- Use verbs for functions.
- Use list comperhensions when possible.
- Ideally, try not do something so complex, but if situation requires complexity, use comments to explain what you are doing.

# Testing

Use the test files from the `test` folder in the repo. Evetually we will find a testing framework to use in the future.

# Reportin Bugs

When you are reporting a bug with the code, please report the following:

- Explain what you were trying to do.
- Provide an example of what you were doing when the bug happen.
- Report any error messages that may appear and put them in the issue.

# Pull Requests

Before putting in a pull request, be sure to test the code before and make sure it meets the style guide before.
